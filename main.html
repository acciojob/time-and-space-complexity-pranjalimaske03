  <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

  <p>
    Time complexity is a measure that describes the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete based on the input size. It is crucial in assessing the efficiency of algorithms. An efficient algorithm has a low time complexity, ensuring faster execution. Developers analyze time complexity using Big O notation to understand how the algorithm's performance scales with different input sizes.

  <p>
    Space Complexity refers to the amount of memory space an algorithm or program requires to solve a computational problem as a function of the input size. In the context of algorithms, 'O(n)' represents linear space complexity, where 'n' is the input size. <b>Space Complexity</b> is a critical consideration in optimizing memory usage and avoiding resource constraints.
