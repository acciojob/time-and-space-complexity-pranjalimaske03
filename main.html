	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a measure of the efficiency of an algorithm, indicating how the running time of an algorithm grows as the size of the input increases. It quantifies the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete in relation to the size of the input. The term "efficient" in the context of time complexity implies that the algorithm performs its computations in a manner that minimizes the time required to obtain the desired results, particularly as the input size becomes larger. In general, lower time complexity values are associated with more efficient algorithms, as they exhibit faster execution times for larger inputs.</p>
    <p><b>Space complexity</b> is a measure that describes the amount of memory space required by an algorithm or a computer program to solve a specific computational problem as a function of the input size. It is often expressed using Big O notation, and when discussing <b>space complexity</b>, you may encounter the term "O(n)," where "n" represents the size of the input.</p>
